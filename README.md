## > [!NOTE]

> While this is pretty past in Linux, it takes around 1 to 2 seconds to scan around 1500k files, in windows it takes around 30 seconds due to system limitations.After
> And while running this program, it is recommended to turn of power saving mode in your device to let the program use more CPU( faster search)
> This program is tested in windows and Linux while I have not tested it in MacOS and if you like to test it in MacOS, please let me know in the issue section of this repo.
